                        PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
                        ===================

Farm Inter-Process Communication Toolkit (FIPC) is an IPC middleware
product designed to be used in distributed computing environemnt
such as farm or clustered environment. It allows processes on different
computers within an FIPC Cluster to communicate and synchronize with
each other across a TCP/IP network.

The following IPC primitive objects are implemented:

+ Binary semaphores (locks)
+ Anonymous counted semaphores (integer flags)
+ Non-anonymous counted semaphores (gates)
+ Queues
+ Lists
+ Text variables

Locks, gates and queues allow automatic clean-up in case of unexpected
shutdown of a client.

The idea of FIPC comes from the E871 collaboration experience of using
Farm Batch System (FBS)for processing their experimental data. Although 
designed for FBS users, FIPC does not depend on FBS and can be used with other
batch systems or even in non-batch environment.

Chain Link Protocol
-------------------
The core of FIPC is Chain Link protocol designed and developed in Fermilab.
The protocol allows any number of collaborating TCP server processes
to form a reliable communication ether (Ring). The protocol allows
the following types of messages:

+ broadcast
+ poll (or sign sheet)
+ direct one-to-one messages

When properly used, the protocol allows any one or more members of the ring to
disconnect and re-connect at any time without loss of information.
FIPC uses the protocol to implement atomic test-and-set operations on
text variables.

Interface
---------
FIPC provides two forms of interface:
+ UNIX shell level user interface (UI) and
+ Python Application Programming Interface (API)

Documentation
-------------
Currently, FIPC documentation is limited to the following:

     FILE                FORMAT       DESCRIPTION
     =================   ======       =========================
     README              ASCII        General, Very Basic Overview

     non_fue/Non-FUE-Install.txt
	                     ASCII        Installation notes for non-FUE users

Required Hardware and Software
------------------------------

FIPC is written primarily in Python, but has some C-language source as well.
Python v1.5 or newer is required for the run-time environment.

FIPC is currently supported under IRIX and Linux operating systems.

                        SUPPORT
                        =======
FIPC is one of a class of Special Products in Fermitools that requires
extra consultation or assistance with proper configuration at set-up or
additional information about its distribution. Therefore, it is available
only upon consultation with the Product Providers and registration in the
Fermilab KITS software distribution system. For assistance, please send
email to the support address for this product:

                   FIPC-support@fnal.gov

This software is furnished by Fermilab on an "as is" basis as a service
to the wider community with the goal of stimulating collaborative use
and further development.

Provision of the software implies no commitment of support by Fermilab.

The Fermilab Computing Division is open to discussing other levels of
support for use of the software with responsible and committed users and
collaborators.

Use of the software in experiments at Fermilab will be assured of a
level of support as agreed to through the standard Memorandum Of
Understanding process.

Users may send mail to the mail address given above, with the
expectation that it will be read and noted.
