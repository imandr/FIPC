				FIPC v1_3 INSTALLATION AND RUNNING

FIPC is FUE-compliant product. To install it, one should use UPS/UPD.
FIPC reuires UPS tailoring. Make sure to specify fipc.table file
when using "ups declare".

Instructions for non-FUE installation can be found in

	non_fue/Non-FUE-Install.txt

FUE Installation
----------------
1. Install FIPC following UPS/UPD instructions.

2. Create FIPC configuration file in some preferrably NFS-shared
directory. This file must be accessable from all potential FIPC
client nodes. The file must be named 'fipc.cfg'.

The file should have one line per FIPC server you are planning
to run. Each line should look like this:

        hostname port1 port2

Port1 and port2 are port numbers servers will use. Make sure that
the numbers are greater than 1024. For example:

        # comments
        fnpca.fnal.gov 5000 7000        # A node can run more than 1 server.
        fnpca.fnal.gov 5001 7001        # In this case, make sure to use different# port numbers
        fnpcb.fnal.gov 5000 7000        # You can use same port numbers on different
        fnpcc.fnal.gov 5000 7000        # nodes

3. Tailor FIPC installation. Issue UPS tailor command:

	ups tailor -O <directory where fipc.cfg is> ... fipc

4. FIPC should be ready for use now.

Running FIPC
-------------
Start some FIPC servers. You do NOT have to run all FIPC servers configured
in the map files. It is enough to run at least one of them. Running
more than one increases chances of FIPC ring to survive single or multiple
node shutdowns, but FIPC responce time is proportional to the number of
servers forming the ring. To start an FIPC server:
	
		cd <FIPC_ROOT>
		./fipc-srv.sh &
		
Here, <server#> represents the number of the server in the fipc-chian.map
file counting from 0. For example, server [fnpca.fnal.gov 6002] is listed
second in the ring map above. To run it, type

		./fipc-srv.sh &
		
You may want to re-direct output of the server to a file or to /dev/null:

		./fipc-srv.sh >/dev/null &
		
Please keep in mind that servers produce a lot of debug output, so expect such
a file to grow quickly.

Make sure that at least one server is running at any time.

FIPC servers DO NOT have to run as root.

Now you have to start FIPC Locals. They have to run under root on EVERY
node of the cluster, both clients and servers:

		su
		Password: ...
		cd <FIPC_ROOT>
		./run_local.sh &
		
FIPC does not require Locals to run, but Locals are needed for automatic
clean-up of dead resource holders.

Verifying FIPC Status
----------------------
After you have started one or more FIPC servers, you can verify whether
they are OK:

		. <FIPC_ROOT>/setup.sh
		fipc ping
		
It should print something like:

		ping 1@host1 3@host5 ...
		
This is the list of servers which are running in the form: <server#>@<host>.

To verify that Local is running on your local host:

		fipc id
		<it prints your id in the form your-session-id@your.local.host>
		fipc finger <your id>
		alive

If id does not print "alive", something is wrong with FIPC Local on your
host.
