                            Abstract
                            
FIPC is a software package which allows users to create distributed
inter-process communication environment. The following objects are
implemented in current version of FIPC:

    - binary semaphore (lock)
    - counted named semaphore (gate)
    - counted anonymous semaphore (integer flag)
    - FIFO queue
	- Double-ended queue
    - text variables
    
FIPC provides various atomic test-and-set operations on these objects.
