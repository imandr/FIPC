FIPC Installation in non-FUE environment
----------------------------------------

***************************************************************
If you do not know what FUE is, then probably you are not in
FUE environemnt, and these instructions are for you.
***************************************************************

1. Create a directory preferrably somewhere in NFS-shared
disk space. This will be the directory where FUE executables
and user libraries reside. Keep in mind that some modules of
FIPC are platform-dependent. Make sure that this directory
is not NFS-shared by computers running different versions of OS.
This directory will be referred to as 'FIPC_ROOT' in this
document.

2. Unwind FIPC distribution tar file in FIPC_ROOT directory.

3. Create another directory, preferrably in NFS-shared by all
computers disk space. This directory will contain platform-independent
FIPC configuration file(s). It will be referred to as FIPC_CONFIG_DIR
in this document.

4. Decide what user will run FIPC servers. This can be any user,
it does NOT have to be root or any other privileged user.
This will be your FIPC_USER.

5. Edit the following files in FIPC_ROOT/non_fue directoris:
	setup_fipc.csh
	setup_fipc.sh
	fipc-srv.sh
	fipc
	fipc_startup.sh
	run_local.sh
Simply follow the instructions included in each file.
You may want to insert necessary commands to set up Python in
setup_fipc.sh and setup_fipc.csh.

6. Copy all files from FIPC_ROOT/non-fue to FIPC_ROOT/bin.

7. Create FIPC configuration file FIPC_CONFIG_DIR/fipc.cfg.
The file should have one line per FIPC server you are planning
to run. Each line should look like this:

	hostname port1 port2
	
Port1 and port2 are port numbers servers will use. Make sure that
the numbers are greater than 1024. For example:

	# comments
	fnpca.fnal.gov 5000 7000	# A node can run more than 1 server.
	fnpca.fnal.gov 5001 7001	# In this case, make sure to use different
								# port numbers
	fnpcb.fnal.gov 5000 7000	# You can use same port numbers on different
	fnpcc.fnal.gov 5000 7000	# nodes
	
8. Start FIPC. On ALL nodes of your cluster, including those listed
in fipc.cfg:
	su or login as root
	make sure Python is in your path
	run FIPC_ROOT/bin/fipc_startup.sh

This will start fipc_local process on all nodes as root, and fipc-srv
processes on all server nodes.

9. Verifying that FIPC is running. As regular user:
	source FIPC_ROOT/bin/setup_fipc.csh or
		. FIPC_ROOT/bin/setup_fipc.sh	
	issue "fipc ping" command. It should print list of running FIPC
	servers.
